# ðŸš— Charge Station
a Charge Station mock app using Compose , Hilt , MVVM with states , coroutines Jetpack navigation

I have enjoyed it as i have played around with compose , did a couple of stuff to test it out but this is only the second time for me to build something in Compose and it was challenging in a good way given the time frame and the requirment

# ðŸš§ what could have been done better
- adding useCase for the domain layer
- adding Ui Models and a mapper for the presentation layer to map data models from domain to UI models
- if i had more time would have tried to clean up compose implementation and animation
- UI enhancment and polishing
- testing
